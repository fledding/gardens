He is considered to be the pioneer of abstract art in Finland.\u2800\n\u2800\nSam Vanni was born in Vyborg. His parents were fur trader Aron Besprosvanni and Rakel Stoler. Samuel was multi-lingual since his early childhood. Family's language at home was Yiddish, but Samuel went to a Swedish school and most of his friends were speaking Finnish. His family moved to Helsinki in 1921 and in 1927 Samuel started studies in the Academy of Fine Arts.\u2800\n\u2800\nLater he studied in the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence and was a private student of the sculptor W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen. In 1931 his works were displayed in an annual Finnish Art Society exhibition.\u2800\n\u2800\nFrom 1938 to 1939 Vanni lived in London and Paris, where he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian and Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re. In the 1940s Vanni started to move towards more abstract art. He was especially influenced by French artists like Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard. Sam Vanni was an active painter until his death in 1992. He was awarded by the Pro Finlandia and invited in the Academy of Finland in 1964.\u2800\n\u2800\nText or it\u2019s fragments is available from Wikipedia under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\n#samvanni #vanni #finnishart #abstract #vocabulart #art #contemporaryart #modernart #contemporary #artist #artgallery #painting #historyofart #arthistory #fineart"}}]},"shortcode":"BsvtuyrDH-B","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":3},"comments_disabled":false,"taken_at_timestamp":1547749290,"dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d586e4c3ce0b5cdd537d08810cd61a09/5D295AA1/t51.2885-15/e35/49808619_397768670974193_6466435264983537024_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","edge_liked_by":{"count":65},"edge_media_preview_like":{"count":65},"location":null,"gating_info":null,"media_preview":"ACoqSW6k3sFzwzDqfU+9RNcy5wp+u5iP5GnN/rHP+238zVaT71Z31Oi1o3XUvuHUZBLfVj/LNNWeQHDnaPqf8akDAc1VluFLAHvwPzrQ59b2f3loyNj7x/M1rRMSi8/wj+VZQ+6K1IfuL/uj+VAXuYLnDyHvvb+ZqAfN8+OvapWI82QerN/M06LaoCn7xOMVl1Oq/uohDbnAz3qR4lLB+45FWpIwy4YcGo3XkADt2rSKtoznbTd0yfjbxWnD9xf90fyrGkfavuMcVrwNmNT6qP5U2SlZfMy54AxJHUMxH1yapKwJw3ykkV0ZjXJ4HU9h61DJDGcEqp59BSfcIt6rpcolkQ/M3b0NLuU8qcj6H+tW5IUJ5VT+Ap0cSAcKPyFMLLcxJz1+tbdt/qk/3V/kKiMMZH3V6+gq/GoCgAAAAfyqIm03e3of/9k=","owner":{"id":"5889162599","username":"vocabulart"},"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ca2f8723521a76940fa6f9f5f014b275/5D1AFD44/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/49808619_397768670974193_6466435264983537024_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","thumbnail_resources":[{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1266805c74be11a16f3d2060329f856c/5D113CE3/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/49808619_397768670974193_6466435264983537024_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c4c740b94fff93ece1f76f7d0637de96/5D2D19A9/t51.2885-15/e35/s240x240/49808619_397768670974193_6466435264983537024_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/515efc93ca160735d06bce4f088ce365/5D4BEE13/t51.2885-15/e35/s320x320/49808619_397768670974193_6466435264983537024_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1de76a6414d0dac9d5991b64d8df7d0c/5D2F2349/t51.2885-15/e35/s480x480/49808619_397768670974193_6466435264983537024_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ca2f8723521a76940fa6f9f5f014b275/5D1AFD44/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/49808619_397768670974193_6466435264983537024_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"is_video":false,"accessibility_caption":"No photo description available."}},{"node":{"__typename":"GraphImage","id":"1957482133610997496","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo (1617 \u2013 1682) was a Spanish Baroque painter.

His best known work is The Scream, painted in 1893.\u2800\n\u2800\nEdvard Munch grew up in a household periodically beset by life-threatening illnesses and the premature deaths of his mother and sister, all of which was explained by Munch\u2019s father, a Christian fundamentalist, as acts of divine punishment. This powerful matrix of chance tragic events and their fatalistic interpretation left a lifelong impression on the young artist, and contributed decisively to his eventual preoccupation with themes of anxiety, emotional suffering, and human vulnerability.\u2800\n\u2800\nMunch intended for his intense colours, semi-abstraction and mysterious, often open-ended themes to function as symbols of universal significance. Thus his drawings, paintings, and prints take on the quality of psychological talismans: having originated in Munch\u2019s personal experiences, they nonetheless bear the power to express, and perhaps alleviate, any viewer\u2019s own emotional or psychological condition.\u2800\n\u2800\nThe frequent preoccupation in Munch\u2019s work with sexual subject matter issues from both the artist\u2019s bohemian valuation of sex as a tool for emotional and physical liberation from social conformity as well as his contemporaries\u2019 fascination with sexual experience as a window onto the subliminal, sometimes darker facets of human psychology.\u2800\n\u2800\nIn a sense similar to his near-contemporary, Vincent van Gogh, Munch strove to record a kind of marriage between the subject as observed in the world around him and his own psychological, emotional and/or spiritual perception.\u2800\n\u2800\n#edvardmunch #norvegianart #thescream #vocabulart #art #contemporaryart#modernart #contemporary #artist#artgallery #painting #historyofart#arthistory #fineart"}}]},"shortcode":"BslRYkwjfdB","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":3},"comments_disabled":false,"taken_at_timestamp":1547398883,"dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a4d7ae3520b254ffc2f35857ae9ca96c/5D4D79DC/t51.2885-15/e35/49933726_339945443400839_1583563883020587535_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","edge_liked_by":{"count":95},"edge_media_preview_like":{"count":95},"location":null,"gating_info":null,"media_preview":"ACoqZcXDJI33yAx5BOOppFu2PeQfXn+tMaUxzPnJG48Z/wBo043KjqDWTXl+JrzP+kSG7bH3n/AGoGvJR90N9WJ/xpkk6uMEZ/E/0qmclvl6Y7VSiupLm+lvki6t5N3PH1P+NdJCT5a8n7o/lXKCM7S7HHp9feurg/1a/wC6P5U9FsJNvc526HLkddzfzNUlYHg8+39R/hV24z5j4/vE/qapuoDZ/hPf0P8AgaSBlqEqo471GMZ47k1SLkZwfX9amicEYPDfof8AA/pT2FuXiodSPY4/DpXQwH92v+6P5CufU8EH0retzmNP91f5CkWjnZ2xKx/22H6mmBFYEMce2Ca3JIYyzZVTk+g9aDDH/dX8hTIOXEcfTf1P91uOv/6vx9qm2RgbSw9jtI59Cf1BrbNtFj7i9f7o/wAKe9vEeqL/AN8j/CmIwlkZPlfJHTPcV1Nv/qk/3V/kKpeRHt+4v/fI/wAK1I1AUAAYwP5UrFXP/9k=","owner":{"id":"5889162599","username":"vocabulart"},"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/df2bac8345d63866d8a8848588a12d50/5D1CAE39/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/49933726_339945443400839_1583563883020587535_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","thumbnail_resources":[{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/07f433c0cf0a9b059ed4af207dc4478c/5D4AA09E/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/49933726_339945443400839_1583563883020587535_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a9aef63621fec39f96b705e94c00a73f/5D470FD4/t51.2885-15/e35/s240x240/49933726_339945443400839_1583563883020587535_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fa3d2de3496c94128bdbe914011917a4/5D45406E/t51.2885-15/e35/s320x320/49933726_339945443400839_1583563883020587535_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6c0af7c87b26d9b557a74f24daf3c7c5/5D4D4234/t51.2885-15/e35/s480x480/49933726_339945443400839_1583563883020587535_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/df2bac8345d63866d8a8848588a12d50/5D1CAE39/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/49933726_339945443400839_1583563883020587535_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"is_video":false,"accessibility_caption":"No photo description available."}},{"node":{"__typename":"GraphImage","id":"1954598360456311352","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853 \u2013 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. He created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings: landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.\u2800\n\u2800\nHe turned to religion, and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter.\u2800\n\u2800\nHis early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including \u00c9mile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include olive trees, cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers.\u2800\n\u2800\nHis suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime. He became famous after his death.\u2800\n\u2800\nHis reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists. He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist.\u2800\n\u2800\nText or it\u2019s fragments is available from Wikipedia under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.\u2800\n\u2800\n#vangogh #vocabulart #art# contemporaryart #modernart#contemporary #artist #artgallery#painting #historyofart #arthistory#fineart"}}]},"shortcode":"BsgINpZjzI4","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":0},"comments_disabled":false,"taken_at_timestamp":1547226303,"dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4c991896da6df1fd0c4c6d04f142300c/5D29C039/t51.2885-15/e35/47691274_280872615931606_4447920190097283199_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","edge_liked_by":{"count":90},"edge_media_preview_like":{"count":90},"location":null,"gating_info":null,"media_preview":"ACoqvSs244J6nufWlBYLkk5PTk0xz87D3NLmq6GXUUu3XJx9ab5vbJ/M0ALnmhuRwOO9IYvmMecnj3NaMZJUH2H8qy8beB37VpRD5F+g/lQNFGYgMfqai8zoD+dLMDuJ6cn+ZqEpgYzn8KQiYnp6GlHTNRBOdnfr+NIzjp0HvQA7d3H61qxfcXr0H8qyBz0rXiPyL9B/KmNGZMfmIH948+nNHl7zncBx6cVcZF3HgdT2qNo19B+QpWEUiAp+ZsheOhxQURjnOPTrVzy1wOB+QpgjUcYH5CgCqOOlbEX3F+g/lVJI1yeB+QrRQDaPoKY0f//Z","owner":{"id":"5889162599","username":"vocabulart"},"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/80104a44e9c580966f2c99608df8572c/5D4CDBDC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47691274_280872615931606_4447920190097283199_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","thumbnail_resources":[{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/23d639562ee5e7aa5d4d2ca9e19fa7f7/5D29FC7B/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/47691274_280872615931606_4447920190097283199_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d1178a38d1897e6fb75cc9f6eba45d8b/5D4D3331/t51.2885-15/e35/s240x240/47691274_280872615931606_4447920190097283199_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/48f6719542b9b64222c31cb8352dbe4c/5D45D28B/t51.2885-15/e35/s320x320/47691274_280872615931606_4447920190097283199_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fab4089c23c2b6e71fc851937103ea05/5D0F95D1/t51.2885-15/e35/s480x480/47691274_280872615931606_4447920190097283199_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/80104a44e9c580966f2c99608df8572c/5D4CDBDC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47691274_280872615931606_4447920190097283199_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"is_video":false,"accessibility_caption":"No photo description available."}},{"node":{"__typename":"GraphImage","id":"1953213290478753730","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"Mar\u00eda Izquierdo (1902 \u2013 1955) was a Mexican painter. She was born Mar\u00eda Cenobia Izquierdo Guti\u00e9rrez in San Juan de los Lagos in the state of Jalisco. After her father died, when she was five years old, she lived with her grandparents and aunt afterward in small towns of Aguascalientes, Torre\u00f3n, and Saltillo. \u2800\n\u2800\nBoth her grandmother and aunt were devout Catholics and much of her upbringing revolved around daily Catholic traditions. At age fourteen she had an arranged marriage to a senior army officer, Colonel C\u00e1ndido Posadas, and bore three children by the time she was 17 years old. \u2800\n\u2800\nIn 1920 she and her family moved to Mexico City from San Juan de los Lagos where she first began to develop into a professional artist. She had a short-lived marriage and became a single mother at a very young age. Izquierdo has three children,two boys and a girl. It is said that her daughter has influenced some of Izquierdo's work, including \"Ninas Durmiendo\". Izquierdo and her family moved to Mexico City where she was able to go to school to study art. There she met her mentors Diego Rivera and Rufino Tamayo, who was also said to be her lover. Izquierdo had a second marriage, also short-lived, with Chilean painter Raul Uribe.\u2800\n\u2800\nAlways interested in art, Izquierdo spent much of her time alone teaching herself new art techniques. When she and her family moved to Mexico City in the 1920s, she acted on her passion and left her husband.\u2800\n\u2800\nMar\u00eda Izquierdo is known for being the first Mexican woman to have her artwork exhibited in the United States. She committed both her life and her career to painting art that displayed her Mexican roots and held her own among famous Mexican male artists: Diego Rivera, Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros.\u2800\n\u2800\nIn December 1955 she died of a stroke in Mexico City.\u2800\n\u2800\nText or it\u2019s fragments is available from Wikipedia under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.\u2800\n\u2800\n#Mar\u00edaIzquierdo #Izquierdo #mexicanart #femaleart #fridakahlo #womanaerist #diegorivera #siqueiros #vocbulart #art#contemporaryart #modernart #contemporary #artist #artgallery #painting #historyofart #arthistory #fineart"}}]},"shortcode":"BsbNSOdjtfC","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":0},"comments_disabled":false,"taken_at_timestamp":1547061190,"dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/320d47fca05c3dcce6576061f8134baf/5D2F5ADB/t51.2885-15/e35/47693171_391445404997033_1919398359486831691_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","edge_liked_by":{"count":57},"edge_media_preview_like":{"count":57},"location":null,"gating_info":null,"media_preview":"ACoqr3FxKJGAdgNzfxH1NRfaZc43v+ZP9aS5/wBa/wDvt/M06J9pOOCRjPp7/h6VJYv2iUfxt+Z/xp3nS9mf/vo/40kwVlBH3u/v/wDWqEk5wOopFb7FgTyn+JvzP+NdFCT5a5J+6O/tXMKT3/Sung/1a/7o/lTRLOZuBmV/QMx/U1JbQrL9/oP68Z/DimzAea49WYfqTT4HZMuOg656e360FW0HCDY2DknoPf6e3ekuoTGSf4Rjn0/+tmrQvMZD8YHQZP41F5jyYDgAA8Z6H6j2pEpsoIwz/ezXUwf6tf8AdH8q5mcBWyoAHtXR25/dJ/ur/IULuDOfuDmR/UMcfmacjIQpYg47YP5cda0pokLk7R1PYetRmGPP3V/IUFLVEACH5yVAzxwTn61LvSQ5J+Qcng9vSlMMePur+Qp7Rp6Dp6ClYXWxkSOGOa6O2/1Sf7i/yFZxhj/ur+QraiUBFAHYfyq9iX2P/9k=","owner":{"id":"5889162599","username":"vocabulart"},"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b6af955dc8e7a2a08efde58b69629435/5D4D3A3E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47693171_391445404997033_1919398359486831691_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","thumbnail_resources":[{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5196a0c97863b0392be5d6bdbd9aee4e/5D165599/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/47693171_391445404997033_1919398359486831691_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/92580db5c008a8a28561c6b0a98235df/5D0DD0D3/t51.2885-15/e35/s240x240/47693171_391445404997033_1919398359486831691_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dd4c386a67d12d8d595701fa3fd31d6c/5D4E6469/t51.2885-15/e35/s320x320/47693171_391445404997033_1919398359486831691_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2e04e2ff3b2028f26b0fba27348c4bd1/5D132333/t51.2885-15/e35/s480x480/47693171_391445404997033_1919398359486831691_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b6af955dc8e7a2a08efde58b69629435/5D4D3A3E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47693171_391445404997033_1919398359486831691_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"is_video":false,"accessibility_caption":"Image may contain: 2 people"}},{"node":{"__typename":"GraphSidecar","id":"1951734426401420784","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"Fernando Botero Angulo (born 19 April 1932) is a Colombian figurative artist and sculptor. Born in Medell\u00edn, his signature style, also known as \"Boterismo\", depicts people and figures in large, exaggerated volume, which can represent political criticism or humor, depending on the piece.\u2800\n\u2800\nHe is considered one of the most recognized and quoted living artist from Latin America. His art can be found in highly visible places around the world, such as Park Avenue in New York City and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris.\u2800\n\u2800\nSelf-titled \"the most Colombian of Colombian artists\" early on, he came to national prominence when he won the first prize at the Sal\u00f3n de Artistas Colombianos in 1958. Working most of the year in Paris, in the last three decades[when?] he has achieved international recognition for his paintings, drawings and sculpture, with exhibitions across the world.[6] His art is collected by many major international museums, corporations, and private collectors. In 2012, he received the International Sculpture Center's Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.[7]99 for the display of her work in the Italian Pavilion.\u2800\n\u2800\nWhile his work includes still-lifes and landscapes, Botero has concentrated on situational portraiture. His paintings and sculptures are united by their proportionally exaggerated, or \"fat\" figures, as he once referred to them.\u2800\n\u2800\nBotero explains his use of these \"large people\", as they are often called by critics, in the following way: \"An artist is attracted to certain kinds of form without knowing why.

A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author Walter Scott and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\u2800\n\u2800\nIn contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the \"forces of the sublime\", of nature in often violent action.\u2800\n\u2800\nHowever, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, \"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.\" Together with Ingres, Delacroix is considered one of the last old Masters of painting, and one of the few who was ever photographed.\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\n#delacroix #frenchart #romanticart #gericault #ingres  #art#contemporaryart #modernart#contemporary #artist #artgallery#painting #historyofart #arthistory#fineart"}}]},"shortcode":"BsQyAudD1Nz","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":2},"comments_disabled":false,"taken_at_timestamp":1546711346,"dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e357f2ad5fc0e76962804558a00860bf/5D4824F8/t51.2885-15/e35/47694337_390529898381689_959908935271618362_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","edge_liked_by":{"count":88},"edge_media_preview_like":{"count":88},"location":null,"gating_info":null,"media_preview":null,"owner":{"id":"5889162599","username":"vocabulart"},"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5ed5940a62031fd79238abeed03c5fab/5D4B0E8B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47694337_390529898381689_959908935271618362_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","thumbnail_resources":[{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c78c86a12bdf027aec650f7732887b5d/5D50136A/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/47694337_390529898381689_959908935271618362_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2b26b95a6b504833a2ff34c7d6b4096f/5D2AEADF/t51.2885-15/e35/s240x240/47694337_390529898381689_959908935271618362_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bb5996fc61d9a3d23c0300f23b90ee00/5D2E0567/t51.2885-15/e35/s320x320/47694337_390529898381689_959908935271618362_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/62c267ff3503cca0aa92e24c4e0a59e4/5D18D43B/t51.2885-15/e35/s480x480/47694337_390529898381689_959908935271618362_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5ed5940a62031fd79238abeed03c5fab/5D4B0E8B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47694337_390529898381689_959908935271618362_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"is_video":false,"accessibility_caption":"Image may contain: 5 people"}},{"node":{"__typename":"GraphSidecar","id":"1948858781396641531","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec(1864 \u2013 1901) was a French painter, printmaker, draughtsman, caricaturist, and illustrator whose immersion in the colourful and theatrical life of Paris in the late 19th century allowed him to produce a collection of enticing, elegant, and provocative images of the modern, sometimes decadent, affairs of those times.\u2800\n\u2800\nToulouse-Lautrec is among the best-known painters of the Post-Impressionist period, with Paul C\u00e9zanne, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin.\u2800\n\u2800\nIn a 2005 auction at Christie's auction house, La Blanchisseuse, his early painting of a young laundress, sold for US$22.4 million and set a new record for the artist for a price at auction.\u2800\n\u2800\nHis debt to the Impressionists, particularly the more figurative painters like Manet and Degas, is apparent, for within his works, one can draw parallels to the detached barmaid at A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re by Manet and the behind-the-scenes ballet dancers of Degas. His style was also influenced by the classical Japanese woodprints which became popular in art circles in Paris.\u2800\n\u2800\nToulouse-Lautrec's skilled depiction of people relied on his painterly style, which is highly linear and emphasizes contour. He often applied paint in long, thin brushstrokes which would leave much of the board underneath showing through.

Cassatt often created images of the social and private lives of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children.\u2800\n\u2800\nCassatt was the daughter of a banker and lived in Europe for five years as a young girl. She was tutored privately in art in Philadelphia.\u2800\n\u2800\nIn 1874 Cassatt chose Paris as her permanent residence and established her studio there. She shared with the Impressionists an interest in experiment and in using bright colours inspired by the out-of-doors. Edgar Degas became her friend; his style and that of Gustave Courbet inspired her own. Like Degas, Cassatt showed great mastery of drawing, and both artists preferred unposed asymmetrical compositions. Cassatt also was innovative and inventive in exploiting the medium of pastels.\u2800\n\u2800\nCassatt urged her wealthy American friends and relatives to buy Impressionist paintings, and in this way, more than through her own works, she exerted a lasting influence on American taste.

He was born into the samurai Oda family, then brought up and educated to become a Rinzai Zen Buddhist priest. However, early in life he displayed a talent for visual arts, and eventually became one of the greatest Japanese artists of his time, widely revered throughout Japan and China.\u2800\n\u2800\nSessh\u016b studied under Tensh\u014d Sh\u016bbun and was influenced by Chinese Song dynasty landscape painting. In 1468\u201369, he undertook a voyage to Ming China, where too he was quickly recognized as an outstanding painter. Upon returning to Japan, Sessh\u016b built himself a studio and established a large following, painters that are now referred to as the Unkoku-rin school \u2014 or \"School of Sessh\u016b\". \u2800\n\u2800\nAlthough numerous works from the period bear Sessh\u016b's signature, name, or seal, only a few can be securely attributed to him. Many are either copies or works by the artist's pupils. Artists most influenced by Sessh\u016b's approach to painting are referred to as belonging to the \"School of Sessh\u016b\".\u2800\n\u2800\nPerhaps the most important surviving work by the master is the so-called Long Scroll of Landscapes: a 15 meters scroll depicting the four seasons in the sequence spring \u2014 summer \u2014 autumn \u2014 winter. \u2800\n\u2800\nHowever, Sessh\u016b alters the Chinese model by introducing more pronounced contrast between light and shadow, thicker, heavier lines, and a flatter effect of space. There are two other large landscape scrolls attributed to Sessh\u016b. The smaller \"Four Seasons\" scroll exhibits qualities similar to those of Sansui Chokan, only featuring somewhat more free technique. View of Ama-no-Hashidate, painted shortly before the artist's death, is a radical departure from the Chinese tradition: the painting presends a realistic bird's eye view of a particular landscape.\u2800\n\u2800\n#SesshuToyo #TenshoShubun #Sesshu #japaneseart #landscape #ink #fineart #art #contemporaryart #modernart #contemporary #artist #artgallery #painting #historyofart #arthistory #fineart #artsy #artlover"}}]},"shortcode":"BsBKM9DD6nQ","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":0},"comments_disabled":false,"taken_at_timestamp":1546187159,"dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/280596b4395399f24ba6f3980d854373/5D0DEDC8/t51.2885-15/e35/47584921_133080644370032_2516089114902238128_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","edge_liked_by":{"count":47},"edge_media_preview_like":{"count":47},"location":null,"gating_info":null,"media_preview":null,"owner":{"id":"5889162599","username":"vocabulart"},"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8ee1d3481bd5aa6a04dc31327e5f4887/5D49FA2D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47584921_133080644370032_2516089114902238128_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","thumbnail_resources":[{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4330e8dc0ff0f58bbfcfe44c74ebe210/5D19348A/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/47584921_133080644370032_2516089114902238128_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/64dda0cf6aa9c1a65a459d7c801bbb13/5D159BC0/t51.2885-15/e35/s240x240/47584921_133080644370032_2516089114902238128_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/375b76283bd79b0b1967d873c7f29caa/5D1C2A7A/t51.2885-15/e35/s320x320/47584921_133080644370032_2516089114902238128_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e7ca132699fc7225014723eac0e7fa23/5D0DE020/t51.2885-15/e35/s480x480/47584921_133080644370032_2516089114902238128_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8ee1d3481bd5aa6a04dc31327e5f4887/5D49FA2D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47584921_133080644370032_2516089114902238128_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"is_video":false,"accessibility_caption":"No photo description available."}},{"node":{"__typename":"GraphSidecar","id":"1944542765674078400","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"Giorgio de Chirico (1888 \u2013 1978) was an Italian artist and writer.

His towers, walls, and plazas seem to flash by, and you are made to feel the power that comes from seeing things that way: you feel you know them more intimately than the people do who live with them day by day.\" Text is available from Wikipedia under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License\u2800\n\u2800\n#chirico #giorgidechirico #italianart #neobaroque #art #contemporaryart #modernart #contemporary #artist #artgallery #painting #historyofart #arthistory #fineart"}}]},"shortcode":"Br8Z1e-jyDA","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":0},"comments_disabled":false,"taken_at_timestamp":1546027583,"dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4f90f15da87977601a9457cf1ac477be/5D49B7CF/t51.2885-15/e35/47481701_274646130073756_8250215296734119429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","edge_liked_by":{"count":121},"edge_media_preview_like":{"count":121},"location":null,"gating_info":null,"media_preview":null,"owner":{"id":"5889162599","username":"vocabulart"},"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c0ec255dc012372249227b4d1e76ee3c/5D49332A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47481701_274646130073756_8250215296734119429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","thumbnail_resources":[{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2eb7b2d1b4a8bab8f54371b0065564e4/5D12428D/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/47481701_274646130073756_8250215296734119429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/322cdc2a19944c01d1d8099f74d9b4cf/5D1C29C7/t51.2885-15/e35/s240x240/47481701_274646130073756_8250215296734119429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a94e06d1ae8404cb09e57a5df517dfb4/5D0D377D/t51.2885-15/e35/s320x320/47481701_274646130073756_8250215296734119429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8d5f2470fc827973d977ea5796dcb061/5D2B3A27/t51.2885-15/e35/s480x480/47481701_274646130073756_8250215296734119429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c0ec255dc012372249227b4d1e76ee3c/5D49332A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47481701_274646130073756_8250215296734119429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"is_video":false,"accessibility_caption":"No photo description available."}},{"node":{"__typename":"GraphSidecar","id":"1943030401623592399","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"\u0410medeo Clemente Modigliani (1884 \u2013 1920) was an Italian painter and sculptor who worked mainly in France. Modigliani spent his youth in Italy, where he studied the art of antiquity and the Renaissance until he moved to Paris in 1906. There he came into contact with prominent artists such as Pablo Picasso and Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i.\u2800\n\u2800\nA central participant in the Ecole de Paris, Modigliani modernized two of the enduring themes of art history: the portrait and the nude. Modigliani's legacy is inextricably bound up with his tragic and bohemian life: his fragile health, which plagued him since childhood; his perpetual pennilessness; and - most famously - his over-the-top, self-destructive lifestyle, which included sexual debauchery and overuse of drugs and alcohol.\u2800\n\u2800\nDuring his life, Amedeo Modigliani had little success, but after his death he achieved greater popularity and his works of art achieved high prices. He died at age 35 in Paris of tubercular meningitis.\u2800\n\u2800\n#modigliani #ecoledeparis #montparnasse #modernism #portrait #art #contemporaryart #modernart #contemporary #artist #artgallery #painting #historyofart #arthistory #fineart"}}]},"shortcode":"Br3B9sMjw3P","edge_media_to_comment":{"count":4},"comments_disabled":false,"taken_at_timestamp":1545847295,"dimensions":{"height":1080,"width":1080},"display_url":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/06f316be7656b3980955ab11bc69547f/5D341318/t51.2885-15/e35/47305104_222924185290298_6286735139543922492_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","edge_liked_by":{"count":206},"edge_media_preview_like":{"count":206},"location":{"id":"6889842","has_public_page":true,"name":"Paris, France","slug":"paris-france"},"gating_info":null,"media_preview":null,"owner":{"id":"5889162599","username":"vocabulart"},"thumbnail_src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/240d94985b9620cfe1ce44c6d1700225/5D5012FD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47305104_222924185290298_6286735139543922492_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","thumbnail_resources":[{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/11b2b2721b8e590ad5ea3829b423f760/5D0D615A/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/47305104_222924185290298_6286735139543922492_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3bb89a5740eaa6895884ab85180a15bd/5D31B710/t51.2885-15/e35/s240x240/47305104_222924185290298_6286735139543922492_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/96c89914cc2bfecf3346342506baeb40/5D2F8EAA/t51.2885-15/e35/s320x320/47305104_222924185290298_6286735139543922492_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/234518a9ceb24cba26082608c036ecbb/5D2E3EF0/t51.2885-15/e35/s480x480/47305104_222924185290298_6286735139543922492_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"https://instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/240d94985b9620cfe1ce44c6d1700225/5D5012FD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47305104_222924185290298_6286735139543922492_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fagc2-1.fna.fbcdn.net","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"is_video":false,"accessibility_caption":"Image may contain: one or more people and text"}}]},"edge_saved_media":{"count":0,"page_info":{"has_next_page":false,"end_cursor":null},"edges":[]},"edge_media_collections":{"count":0,"page_info":{"has_next_page":false,"end_cursor":null},"edges":[]}}},"felix_onboarding_video_resources":{"mp4":"/static/videos/felix-onboarding/onboardingVideo.mp4/9d16838ca7f9.mp4","poster":"/static/images/felix-onboarding/onboardingVideoPoster.png/8fdba7cf2120.png"},"show_follow_dialog":false}
